# Work-Day-Scheduler

Simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code.

## Description

Third-Party APIs: Daily Planner App
This Challenge will require you to leverage all the skills you've learned so far, requiring you to think about DOM manipulation, advanced JavaScript, integration of third-party APIs, and more. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the Day.jsLinks to an external site. library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Day.js in the browser.

Before you begin, download your starter codeLinks to an external site. for this Challenge and unzip the zip file.
